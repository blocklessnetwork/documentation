Imagine an internet powered by the people, for the people.

With Bless, your device becomes part of a global, community-driven supercomputer —no more reliance on tech monopolies to provide the internet’s backbone.

## The New Status Quo

Your role is simple but powerful. You’re transforming your device into a compute node that gives unused processing power to a network that puts users first.

**You** help build the future of decentralized infrastructure by contributing to a **cloud of people** -- a shared, community -- run resource built to support the apps and services you already use every day.
