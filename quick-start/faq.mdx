<Accordion title='How many nodes can I run?'>
    One account per person can link up to 5 devices, and run only one node per
    device. Nodes require significant resources, which can put a strain on
    system CPU, memory, and bandwidth. Running multiple nodes across browsers
    will not lead to increased rewards, and could lead to bugs that may not be
    patched.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='What devices can I run the extension on?'>
    You can run the extension on any device that supports Google Chrome
    extensions. While it technically works on mobile, we highly recommend using
    a computer or laptop for better performance, as mobile devices may limit
    connectivity, drain battery quickly, and experience frequent bugs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Can I use a VPS to run a node?'>
    To ensure fairness to all users and simulate the actual environment we'll be
    running on Mainnet launch, VPS use is prohibited and will not be rewarded.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Can I run multiple nodes on the same IP address?'>
    While this is allowed, our platform has mechanisms in place to ensure
    fairness. This prevents any advantage based on multiple nodes using the same
    IP address.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='How does the Chrome extension use my deviceâ€™s compute power?'>
    The Chrome extension functions as a browser node that processes distributed
    computational tasks directly on your device. By using a WebAssembly sandbox,
    the Bless browser node ensures that all operations run securely within an
    isolated environment, keeping your system safe and uncompromised.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='What are your data privacy policies for connecting my device?'>
    We operate on a fully decentralized network, meaning your participation does
    not compromise your personal data. Nodes handle workloads in a secure,
    trustless environment, ensuring privacy throughout.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='How does Bless ensure fairness across nodes?'>
    Bless uses Dynamic Resource Matching, pairing tasks with nodes best suited
    to handle them. This ensures every task is matched to the best-fit node
    based on its capabilities, keeping the network balanced and efficient.
