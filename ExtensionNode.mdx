### **Welcome to the World’s First Shared Computer**

Imagine an internet powered by the people, for the people. With Bless, your device becomes part of a global, community-driven supercomputer —no more reliance on tech monopolies to provide the internet’s backbone.

### **The New Status Quo**

Your role is simple but powerful. You’re transforming your device into a compute node that gives unused processing power to a network that puts users first.

**You** help build the future of decentralized infrastructure by contributing to a **cloud of people**—a shared, community-run resource built to support the apps and services you already use every day.

### **How to Run a Bless Extension Node:**

1. **Connect to the Dashboard**
   Sign into the [**Bless Dashboard**](https://bless.network/dashboard) with your preferred login method

2. **Download the Extension**
   From your dashboard, you’ll see a large white button to “[Download Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bless/pljbjcehnhcnofmkdbjolghdcjnmekia?hl=en)”. Head to the Chrome Web Store Bless extension page and hit “Add to Chrome”.

3. **Activate and Connect**
   You will automatically be directed to the dashboard where your node should start automatically. Now open your extensions tab and open the browser extension.

4. **Start Powering the Network Built for You**
   Roll call takes place every 10 minutes, that time is then added to your dashboard. You’re now receiving real workloads, tailored to your location and system capacity.

5. **Explore your Dashboard**
   Your dashboard is the key to your progress, flick between your active nodes, time accrued, achievements and more.

6. **It’s About Time**
   The clock starts now. Join the Blessed by running nodes, inviting friends to the network, and diving into community quests. The more you contribute, the faster the clock runs.

For any support queries, please join the [Bless Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/blessnetwork) and open a support ticket at the bottom of the channel after verifying.

### **FAQ:**

1. **How many nodes can I run?**
   **One account** per person can link up to **5 devices**, and **run only one node per device.** Nodes require significant resources, which can put a strain on system CPU, memory, and bandwidth. Running multiple nodes across browsers will not lead to increased rewards, and could lead to bugs that may not be patched.

2. **What devices can I run the extension on?**
   You can run the extension on any device that supports Google Chrome extensions. While it technically works on mobile, we highly recommend using a computer or laptop for better performance, as mobile devices may limit connectivity, drain battery quickly and experience frequent bugs.

3. **Can I use a VPS to run a node?**
   To ensure fairness to all users and simulate the actual environment we'll be running on Mainnet launch, VPS use is prohibited and will not be rewarded.

4. **Can I run multiple nodes on the same IP address?**
   While this is allowed, our platform has mechanisms in place to ensure fairness. This prevents any advantage based on multiple nodes using the same IP address.

5. **How does the Chrome extension use my device’s compute power?**
   The Chrome extension functions as a browser node that processes distributed computational tasks directly on your device. By using a WebAssembly sandbox, the Bless browser node ensures that all operations run securely within an isolated environment, keeping your system safe and uncompromised.

6. **What are your data privacy policies for connecting my device?**
   We operate on a fully decentralized network, meaning your participation does not compromise your personal data. Nodes handle workloads in a secure, trustless environment, ensuring privacy throughout.

7. **How does Bless ensure fairness across nodes?**
   Bless uses Dynamic Resource Matching, pairing tasks with nodes best suited to handle them. This ensures every task is matched to the best-fit node based on its capabilities, keeping the network balanced and efficient.
