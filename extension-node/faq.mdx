    <Tab title="Extension Node">
        <Accordion title='How many nodes can I run?'>
            **One account** can link up to **5 devices**, and **run only one node per
            device**. Running multiple nodes across browsers will not lead to increased
            rewards, and could lead to bugs that will not be patched.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='What devices can I run the extension on?'>
            You can install the extension on any device that supports Google Chrome extensions. While it may work on mobile, we strongly recommend using a computer or laptop for better performance, as mobile devices may limit connectivity, drain battery quickly, and experience frequent bugs.

        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Can I use a VPS to run a node?'>
            To ensure fairness to all users and simulate the actual environment we'll be
            running on Mainnet launch, VPS usage will not be rewarded.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Can I run multiple nodes on the same IP address?'>
            While this is allowed, our platform has mechanisms in place to ensure
            fairness. This prevents any advantage based on multiple nodes using the same
            IP address.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='How does the Chrome extension use my deviceâ€™s compute power?'>
            The Chrome extension functions as a browser node that processes distributed
            computational tasks directly on your device. By using a WebAssembly sandbox,
            the Bless browser node ensures that all operations run securely within an
            isolated environment, keeping your system safe and uncompromised.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='What are your data privacy policies for connecting my device?'>
            We operate on a fully decentralized network, meaning your participation does
            not compromise your personal data. Nodes handle workloads in a secure,
            trustless environment, ensuring privacy throughout.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='How does Bless ensure fairness across nodes?'>
            Bless uses Dynamic Resource Matching, pairing tasks with nodes best suited
            to handle them. This ensures every task is matched to the best-fit node
            based on its capabilities, keeping the network balanced and efficient.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='What is the difference between Bless Node and Bless CLI?'>
            Bless Node is a native software or browser extension that any users can
            install and run to provide compute resoureces to the Bless Network and earn
            rewards. Bless CLI is the developer-facing software that allows the
            application developer to utilize the compute resources on the Bless Network.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Testnet">
        <Accordion title='I participated in earlier Testnet stages. Will they still count?'>
           Yes! All contributions from previous Testnet stages will be recognized. Rewards will be distributed based on participation across all stages.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Do I earn rewards via Bless CLI?'>
            No, only the **Bless Extension Node** is part of the incentivized Testnet. Participation via Bless CLI does not qualify for rewards.
