Bless is the world’s first shared computer — a decentralized, efficient, and people-powered alternative to traditional cloud services.

Developers can deploy applications with ultra-low latency and minimal cost, while anyone with spare computing resources can run a node, contributing to the network and earning rewards.

## Our Vision

At Bless, we believe that access to compute is a basic human right.

In the age of AI and computer based automation, the ability to harness and utilize compute is as fundamental as access to electricity or clean water. By democratizing computing, we aim to bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots. We envision a future where computing is accessible, equitable, and beneficial to everyone.

By eliminating the need for centralized infrastructure, we reduce costs and complexities for developers while providing opportunities for individuals to turn their idle machines into active participants in the global cloud. The cause is simple: democratize computing and ensure that the benefits of the web flow back to its users — not just corporations.
