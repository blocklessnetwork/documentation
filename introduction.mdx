## What is EigenExplorer

<Card title='TL;DR' icon='arrow-right'>
    EigenExplorer is an EigenLayer-native DeFi and data platform. 
    
    <br />
    Our main product is a new class of asset called [**Liquid AVS Token (LAT)**](/lat/introduction), which enables users to restake directly into AVS and get back a liquid and composable LAT token which represents the staked position.

EigenExplorer is a platform which **services Restakers, AVS, and Operators** — the core entities of the restaking ecosystem.

Via an expanding suite of services, EigenExplorer enables users to engage with EigenLayer’s rapidly growing actively validated service (AVS) ecosystem — through direct DeFi participation and data analytics.

### How It Works

The world's first shared computer is a global network powered by everyday devices - from Macbooks to desktops and everything in between. Instead of Amazon, Google and Microsoft reaping the rewards of the internet we've built - you can instead.
Here's how you can get involved in our testnet and take back control of the internet we love and use everyday.

### Why We Exist

EigenLayer continues to expand; a large number of projects have already been established on the protocol, including rollups, coprocessors, oracles and more. Each AVS boasts its own set of features, its own security parameters and its own community of backers. As this ecosystem grows, so too does the need for users to be able to select which AVS they wish to support.

Currently, EigenExplorer provides two interlocking products: a decentralized finance protocol and a robust data service supporting it. Combining the functionalities of a liquidity layer with the comprehensive data tools already provided, EigenExplorer enables users to restake directly into AVSs - and provides them with the data they need to make these restaking decisions.

EigenExplorer is now an invaluable tool for users, allowing the EigenLayer community to navigate the mass of non-standardised data generated by the expanding AVS landscape. Today, the platform successfully completes over a million data requests every month from AVS developers, users and EigenLayer itself.

To support the continued sustainable development of the EigenLayer ecosystem, EigenExplorer developed the [Liquid AVS Token (LAT)](/lat/introduction), designed specifically for deployment among AVSs. LAT streamlines liquidity provision and enables users to directly support their preferred AVSs, bypassing the need for separate restaking protocols. LAT allows users direct access to each AVS, and helps AVS teams to build and develop their own dedicated communities.

For a full discussion of LAT’s design and mechanics, please see the [next section](/lat/introduction).
