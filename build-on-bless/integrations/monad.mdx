[Monad](https://monad.xyz) is a high-throughput, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that exposes the familiar JSON-RPC 2.0 interface. With the Bless SDK’s `fetch` function you can retrieve blocks, initiate transactions, and more, all with a single HTTP POST request. This approach works perfectly in client-side or WASM environments such as Bless nodes.

This guide demonstrates a **minimal “latest block” query** using a public testnet RPC. Feel free to substitute another provider (Alchemy, QuickNode, Ankr, etc.) if you need higher rate limits.

By the end of this guide you will:

- Select a public RPC endpoint
- Call `eth_blockNumber`
- Convert the hexadecimal result to a decimal block height

## Quick Notes

- **No authentication tokens are required** for public endpoints, but each RPC provider enforces its own rate limits. For production workloads, request an API key from a provider like Alchemy or QuickNode to increase those limits.

## Full Example (JS/TS)

```ts
async function getEthBlockNumber(url: string) {
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      id: 1,
      method: 'eth_blockNumber',
      params: []
    })
  })
  const data = await response.json()
  const blockNumber = parseInt(data.result, 16)
  console.log(`Latest block: ${blockNumber} (0x${data.result})`)
}

// Get the latest block number from the Monad testnet
getEthBlockNumber('https://rpc.ankr.com/monad_testnet').catch(console.error)
```

### Example Output

```
Latest Monad block: 27375104 (0x1a1b2c0)
```

With this snippet, you now have a lightweight, dependency-free way to pull on-chain state from Monad directly in your Bless app. Happy building!
