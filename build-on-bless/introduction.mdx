## Welcome

Bless Network is a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services. Instead of relying on a few large data centers, Bless harnesses the collective resources of its participants to create a shared global computer.

This documentation outlines how you can interact with the Bless Network from a developerâ€™s perspective and deploy your workloads or applications using the Bless CLI.

To learn more about ways Bless Network is different, checkout the [Learn](../learn/network/orchestration) section.

## Bless CLI

The Bless Command Line Interface (CLI) is your primary tool for deploying applications to the Bless Network. It provides everything you need to manage projects, handle deployments, and maintain resources.

### Development Workflow

The Bless CLI guides you through the entire development process:

1. Project Creation: Initialize new projects with best-practice templates
2. Local Development: Build and test your applications in a local environment
3. Deployment: Deploy your applications to the Bless Network using simple commands
4. Management: Monitor and update deployed applications as needed

### Account and Resource Management

The CLI also helps you manage your presence on the network:

1. Account Management: Create and manage your developer account
2. Wallet Integration: Manages your Solana wallet address
3. Resource Monitoring: Track resource consumption and associated costs
