## Overview

Welcome to the Bless developer documentation. This guide provides everything you need to understand and interact with the Bless Network, from deploying workloads to managing resources using the Bless CLI.

<Warning>
    Bless is currently in beta (Testnet) and is not yet ready for production
    use.
</Warning>

## What is Bless?

Bless is a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services. Instead of relying on a centralized network of large data centers, it leverages a globally distributed network of nodes to create a shared, decentralized computing infrastructure.

Currently, Bless Network has over **1.2 million nodes** online each day. By utilizing previously untapped resources, Bless can offer significantly lower costs compared to traditional cloud providers.

This documentation will guide you through developing, deploying, and managing applications on the Bless.

To learn more about how Bless differs from traditional cloud solutions, visit the [Learn](../learn/network/) section.

## Supported Languages and Frameworks

<Warning>
    During the testnet phase, external API access is disabled. Contact support
    for more information.
</Warning>
We currently supports both TypeScript and JavaScript applications. Additional language
and framework support will be introduced in future updates.

## Bless CLI

The Bless Command Line Interface (CLI) is your primary tool for deploying applications to the Bless Network. It provides everything you need to manage projects, handle deployments, and maintain resources.
