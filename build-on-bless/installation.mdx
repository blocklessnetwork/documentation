## Prerequisites

Before installing the Bless CLI, ensure you have:

-   `Node.js` (version 18 or higher)
-   `npm` (Node Package Manager)

You can check your installed versions using:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don’t have Node.js installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

<Note>
    Some npm modules require a Python dependency on Windows. Ensure that Python
    is installed on your system. If it is not, you can download and install it
    from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
</Note>

To start using the Bless CLI, run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using npx
npx blessnet
```

```bash Global installation
npm install -g blessnet
```

</CodeGroup>

Global installation allows you to use the `blessnet` command directly, without the need for the `npx` prefix.

#### First-Time Setup

On your first run, you'll be prompted to install the BLESS Runtime:

```bash
➜ npx blessnet
BLESS environment not found. Do you want to install it? (yes/no): y
✔ Installation successful.
BLESS environment installed successfully.
```

After installation, the CLI will be ready to use.

## CLI Help

If you get stuck, use the `help` command to display a list of available commands and usage instructions.

```bash
npx blessnet help
```
