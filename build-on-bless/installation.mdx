## Prerequisites

Before installing the Bless CLI, ensure you have:

-   `Node.js` (version 18 or higher)
-   `npm` (Node Package Manager)

You can check your installed versions using:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don’t have Node.js installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

To start using the Bless CLI immediately, run:

```bash
npx blessnet
```

#### First-Time Setup

On your first run, you'll be prompted to install the BLESS Runtime:

```bash
➜ npx blessnet
BLESS environment not found. Do you want to install it? (yes/no): y
✔ Installation successful.
BLESS environment installed successfully.
```

After installation, the CLI will be ready to use.

### Global Installation (For Frequent Use)

If you plan to use the Bless CLI regularly, install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g blessnet
```

This allows you to run the Bless CLI directly without npx:

```bash
blessnet
```

## CLI Help

The Bless CLI provides different responses based on your working directory.

-   Inside a BlessNet project: Displays the project state.
-   Outside a project: Launches an interactive initializer.

For detailed command options, run:

```bash
blessnet help
```

This will display a list of available commands and usage instructions.
