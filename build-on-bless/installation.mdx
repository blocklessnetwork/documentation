## Installation

To start using the Bless CLI, run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using npx
npx blessnet
```

```bash Global installation
npm install -g blessnet
```

</CodeGroup>

Global installation allows you to use the `blessnet` command directly, without the need for the `npx` prefix.

#### First-Time Setup

On your first run, you'll be prompted to install the BLESS Runtime:

```bash
➜ npx blessnet
BLESS environment not found. Do you want to install it? (yes/no): y
✔ Installation successful.
BLESS environment installed successfully.
```

After installation, the CLI will be ready to use.

## CLI Help

If you get stuck, use the `help` command to display a list of available commands and usage instructions.

```bash
npx blessnet help
```
