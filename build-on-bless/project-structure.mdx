## Creating a New Project

When you create a new Bless project, the Bless CLI automatically sets up a well-structured folder hierarchy. We currently support both JavaScript and TypeScript.

To create a new BlessNet project, run:

```bash
npx blessnet init my-first-project
cd my-first-project
```

This will generate all the necessary files and folders for your project.

## Directory Structure

A newly initialized Bless project follows this structure:

```text
.
├── bls.toml              # Project configuration
├── index.ts              # Entry point
├── package.json          # Dependencies
├── tsconfig.base.json    # Base TypeScript config
├── tsconfig.debug.json   # Debug TypeScript config
└── tsconfig.release.json # Release TypeScript config
```

### File & Folder Breakdown

#### 1. bls.toml (Project Configuration)

Stores global settings and metadata for your Bless project. This file must not be deleted, as the network uses it to manage configurations.

#### 2. index.ts (Main Entry Point)

This is where your project starts execution. Modify this file to define how your application runs.

#### 3. package.json (Dependency Manager)

Handles project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

#### 4. TypeScript Configurations (tsconfig.\*.json)

| File                    | Purpose                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `tsconfig.base.json`    | Shared TypeScript settings for all environments. |
| `tsconfig.debug.json`   | Optimized for development & debugging.           |
| `tsconfig.release.json` | Optimized for production builds.                 |
