To connect your project to an external API, you’ll need to update your `bls.toml` file with the right permissions before deploying.

## Step 1: Add API Domains to Your `bls.toml`

Open your `bls.toml` file and, under the `[deployment]` section, add a `permissions` line listing your API domains:

```toml
[deployment]
permission = "public"
nodes = 1
permissions = [ "https://yourapiwebsite/" ]
```

- **Replace** `https://yourapiwebsite/` with your actual API's base URL.
- **Include the full domain and protocol** (e.g., `https://api.example.com/` not just `example.com`).
- **Subdomains must be separately listed.** If you're using both `https://example.com/` and `https://api.example.com/`, you need both in your permissions array.

Example with multiple APIs:

```toml
[deployment]
permission = "public"
nodes = 1
permissions = [ "https://api.example1.com/", "https://api.example2.com/" ]
```

---

## Step 2: Call APIs in Your Code

Once your API domains are set up, you can make calls using `fetch` like you normally would:

```jsx
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://yourapiwebsite/data");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

getData();
```

- `Only fetch is supported` now.
- **The requested URL must exactly match** what you set in `permissions`.

## Important Notes

- **Permissions are locked at deploy time.** You can’t update them later without redeploying.
- **HTTPS only.** The Shared Computer rejects non-secure HTTP API calls.
- **CORS is your responsibility.** Bless doesn’t modify CORS headers. Make sure the API you’re calling allows cross-origin requests.
- **Security first.** Only trusted, necessary APIs should be listed.
