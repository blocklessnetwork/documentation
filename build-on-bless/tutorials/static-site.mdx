One of the easiest things you can do to build on the Bless Network is to publish your very own static website. It could be your personal website or a website to host memes.

Here we will show you a simple, one-page website you can follow along and ship to the Bless Network under 10 minutes.

---

## Pre-requisites

Before publishing your first static website to the Bless Network, you will need to install the Bless CLI. If you haven't already, follow the [installation guide](../installation) to download the Bless CLI.

Now, letâ€™s install Blessnet and sign in.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Open a Terminal

In **GitHub Codespaces**, the terminal is already built in! Just look for it at the bottom of the screen. If you donâ€™t see it, click **View â†’ Terminal**.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Install Blessnet

First, install the Bless environment:

```sh
npx blessnet
```

Type **y** and press enter to continue.

If Blessnet isnâ€™t installed yet, youâ€™ll see this message:

```
BLESS environment not found. Do you want to install it? (yes/no):
```

Type **yes** and press enter to continue.

Congratulations, Hitchhiker! You now have the Blessnet environment installed and can use the `blessnet` command.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Create Your First Project

```sh
npx blessnet init
```

You will see:

```
No bls.toml file detected in the current directory.
Initialize project? (yes/no):
```

Type **yes**.

It will ask you:

```
Enter a name for the project:
```

Type **my-first-site** and press enter.

You will see:

```
âœ” project initialized successful.
```

This creates a folder called `my-first-site`. Enter the directory:

```sh
cd my-first-site
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Login to Bless

Run:

```sh
npx blessnet account login
```

Enter your email and verify it.

## Step 2: Build a Simple Website (With Help from ChatGPT)

Now we will create an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Create the Files

In **GitHub Codespaces**, locate the **file explorer** on the left.

1. **Right-click** your project folder â†’ **New Folder** â†’ Name it `public`.

2. **Right-click** `public` â†’ **New File** â†’ Create:

    - `index.html`

    - `style.css`

    - `script.js`

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Add Code to `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Bless Network</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Welcome to Blessnet</h1>
            <img
                src="https://i.ibb.co/vvbN7FJ/2333232-removebg-preview.png"
                alt="Custom Image"
            />
            <h1>This page is brought to you by <em>The Bless Network</em></h1>
            <button id="alertButton">Click Me</button>
        </div>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Add Styles to `style.css`

```css
body {
    background: gold;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
}
img {
    max-width: 300px;
    border: 5px solid black;
    border-radius: 15px;
}
button {
    background: black;
    color: gold;
    border: none;
    padding: 12px 24px;
    font-size: 18px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-top: 15px;
    transition: 0.3s;
}
button:hover {
    background: darkgoldenrod;
    color: black;
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Add Interactivity with `script.js`

```js
function changeText() {
    alert('Ouch, why did you do that');
}
document.getElementById('alertButton').addEventListener('click', changeText);
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Edit your `index.ts`

Now go back to your my-first-site folder and find `index.ts`, then replace the code for hello world with this:

```js
import WebServer from '@blockless/sdk-ts/dist/lib/web';
const server = new WebServer();

server.statics('public');
server.start();
```

## Step 3: Deploy Your Website

Time to launch your website on the **Blessnet**!

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Build and Preview Your Site

```sh
npx blessnet preview serve
```

You will see:

```
Server listening at http://localhost:3000
```

Click the link, and your website is live (on your local machine).

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Deploy to Bless

```sh
npx blessnet deploy
```

Youâ€™ll get a **deployment URL**, like:

```
Deployment URL: https://your-website.bls.dev
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Congrats! Your website is now live!**

## Step 4: Use AI to Build and Edit Your Website

### ðŸ”¹ How to Update Your Site:

1. **Copy the new code** from ChatGPT.

2. **Open your file** in GitHub Codespaces.

3. **Paste the updated code** into the correct file.

4. **Save the file (Ctrl + S / Cmd + S).**

5. **Preview changes:**

```sh
npx blessnet preview serve
```

1. **Deploy the new version:**

```sh

```

Your Blessnet site is officially out in the wild, powered by the **worldâ€™s first shared computer**.

**Stay Blessed!** ðŸš€
