Deploying your app to Bless Network requires just a single command. If you haven't already created a project, start by running:

```bash
npx blessnet init <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

Once your project is set up, navigate to the project directory and deploy it with:

```bash
npx blessnet deploy
```

This command will automatically **build** your application and **deploy** it to the Bless Network. Upon successful deployment, you will receive:

-   A **CID (Content Identifier)** for your binary storage on IPFS
-   A **URL** for accessing your deployed application

## Building and Previewing Locally

To build and preview your app before deployment, use:

```bash
npx blessnet preview
```

This command **compiles your application** and **launches a local development server**, allowing you to test it before going live.

If you just want to build your application, use the `npx blessnet options build` command.
