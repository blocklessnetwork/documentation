In the Bless network, compute workloads are distributed to nodes using a combination of decentralized orchestration, resource optimization, and incentivization mechanisms.

***

#### **1. Developer Submission**

1. **Workload Request:**

   * The Developer submits a compute task via the Bless Command Line Interface (e.g., deploying a static site, running an AI model, or executing a dynamic application).

   * The request includes metadata about the workload, such as:

     * Resource requirements (CPU, RAM, bandwidth)

     * Priority and latency expectations

     * Duration or deadline for task completion

2. **Packaging the Workload:**

   * The workload is encapsulated in a secure and standardized format (e.g., WebAssembly). This ensures compatibility across all nodes in the network.

***

#### **2. Task Routing and Matching**

1. **Node Discovery:**

   * The Bless network maintains a real-time registry of active nodes, their geographic locations, and their available resources.

   * The network then identifies online nodes that match the taskâ€™s requirements.

2. **Optimization Algorithms:**

   * To minimize latency, workloads are routed to nodes closest to the user or end-consumer.

   * Tasks are distributed based on resource efficiency, ensuring that no single node is overwhelmed while maximizing network utilization.

3. **Incentive Considerations:**

   * Nodes are prioritized based on their historical performance, uptime, and reliability.

   * Nodes are rewarded proportionally for their contributions.

***

#### **3. Secure Distribution**

1. **Task Encryption:**

   * Workloads are encrypted before being sent to nodes to ensure security and privacy.

   * Each node receives only the data it needs to execute the workload, preventing unauthorized access.

2. **Decentralized Storage Integration:**

   * For tasks requiring large datasets, the workload might reference external storage systems like IPFS or Arweave. Nodes fetch necessary data using secure protocols.
