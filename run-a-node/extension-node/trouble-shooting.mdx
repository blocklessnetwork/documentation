If you're experiencing issues with the Bless Extension, this guide provides solutions to the most common problems. If the issue persists, please open a support ticket in the [Bless Discord](https://discord.com/invite/blessnetwork) for further assistance.

<Accordion title='User already exists with a different type of login'>

    You need to log in using the same method and email you originally signed up
    with.

    Bless supports three login methods: **Email, GitHub, and Google**. If you’re
    seeing this error, you’re likely using the wrong login
    method. Try all available methods to resolve the issue.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Unable to verify my device through Web3 Auth'>

    Bless currently uses Web3 Auth, an external authentication provider. We are aware of the login issues caused by Web3 Auth's service and are actively migrating to a more reliable authentication system.

    If you're affected, please try again later and bear with us as we complete the transition.

<Accordion title='Node registration failed'>
    
    This error can occur for several reasons. Try the following solutions:

    1. **Temporary Server or Regional Outage**

        Check our Discord for updates on any ongoing server issues.

    2. **Exceeding the 5-Node Limit**

        Each account can register up to 5 active nodes. If you're trying to register a 6th node, it won’t launch.

        To fix this, try retire a node in the Bless Dashboard, under the `My Nodes` page.

    3. **General Connection Issues**

        If none of the above resolve your issue, try these troubleshooting steps:

          - Clear your browser cache
          - Log out and log back in (both from the Browser Dashboard and the Extension)
          - Restart your extension by clicking your profile icon in the Browser Dashboard
