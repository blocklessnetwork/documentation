This guide will walk you through installing and running a **Bless Native Node** using Docker.  

## Prerequisites  

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:  

- A machine (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with internet access.
- Docker installed. If not [download here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a `.env` Configuration File  

First, create a new folder for your node setup. Inside this folder, create a `.env` file and add the following configuration:  

```properties .env
NODE_ROLE=worker
BOOT_NODES=/ip4/143.244.211.194/tcp/9010/p2p/12D3KooWGuBya7RYHTzZmR7uLJYUXffSPuBUPKnmYSfsgwyjqFuw

# (Optional) S3 Backup Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<s3_id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<s3_key>
KEY_PATH=<backup_key_path>
KEY_PASSWORD=<key_password>
```

<Note>Replace `<s3_id>`, `<s3_key>`, `<backup_key_path>`, and `<key_password>` with your actual credentials if using S3 backup. </Note> 

### 2. Start Your Bless Node  

Navigate to the folder where your `.env` file is located and run the following command in your terminal to start your node:  

```bash Terminal
docker run -d \
  --name blessnetwork-node \
  -p 9527:9527 \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/blessnetwork/b7s:0.6.6.patch3
```

## Next Steps  

Your **Bless Node** should now be up and running, actively contributing to the network!

Now it's time to **manage your node** and ensure optimal performance. Check out our [Node Management Guide](./node-mgmt) for detailed instructions on monitoring, stopping, and backing up your node.
