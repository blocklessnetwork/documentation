    1. Check if port **9527** is already in use  

        Run the following command to check:  

        ```bash Terminal
        sudo lsof -i :9527
        ```

        If the port is in use, either stop the conflicting process or change the port in your Docker command.

    2. Verify your `.env` file  

        Ensure all required values are correctly entered and formatted. 

    3.  Check Docker logs for errors  

        Run the following command to inspect logs:  

        ```bash Terminal
        docker logs blessnetwork-node
        ```
    4. Ensure your internet connection is stable  

        A weak or unstable internet connection may prevent your node from connecting to the network.
